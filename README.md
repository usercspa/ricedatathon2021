# Rice Datathon 2021

2nd.MD Track information (from slides)

Description: As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a global shift towards remote business operations. The medical field is no different, as the shift towards telemedicine was heavily accelerated by the pandemic. Data from the CDC shows that there was a 154% YoY increase in telemedicine visits during March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. By summer 2020, however, there was a sharp decline in telemedicine appointments as patients opted to return to in-office appointments. This distinct change in behavior brings into question what the future of telemedicine will look like.
